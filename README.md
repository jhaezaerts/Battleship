# Battleship
This project contains a single screen, two-player game called Battleship.

The game is played by exactly two players. They are presented with one board filled with gray tiles. Somewhere on this board, four ships of different sizes are hidden. The players each take turns clicking the tiles. The smaller the ship, the more points they will obtain. The game is over when all ships have sunk and the player who hit the most (valuable) ships, and thus scored the most points wins the game.
